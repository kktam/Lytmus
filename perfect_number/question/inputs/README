This folder contains input files to test your program.
You may modify these files or add your own - they are purely for debugging.

Each JSON file contains a dictionary with input parameters to your program.
For example:
    {
        "input": 0
    }

To test your program using the JSON file run:
    node test_answer.js ./inputs/divide_by_zero.json

This calls answer() in answer.js as follows:
    answer(input)

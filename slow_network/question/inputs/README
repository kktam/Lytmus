This folder contains input files to test your program.
You may modify these files or add your own - they are purely for debugging.

Each JSON file contains a dictionary with input parameters to your program.
For example:
    {
        "log_path": "/home/candidate/candidate_files/js/inputs/large.log"
    }

To test your program using the JSON file run:
    node test_answer.js ./inputs/large.json

This calls analyze_requests() in answer.js as follows:
    analyze_requests(log_path)
